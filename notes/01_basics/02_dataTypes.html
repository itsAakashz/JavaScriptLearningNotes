            <h2>Primitive and Non-primitive data-types</h2>
            <p>Primitive data types:
            The predefined data types provided by JavaScript language are known as primitive data types. Primitive data types are also known as in-built data types. <br>
                Ex- Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol, BigInt.
            <br>
            Non-primitive data types:
            The data types that are derived from primitive data types of the JavaScript language are known as non-primitive data types. It is also known as derived data types or reference data types. <br>
            Ex-Object, Array </p>
